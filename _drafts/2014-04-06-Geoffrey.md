We recently had a 'hardware hack' [@leftlogic](http://twitter.com/leftlogic) which was great, fucking around with arduinos really got me thinking seriously abotu what I can do with a little hardware
and a node server. So a few day's later and its my birthday and I have my very own Raspberry Pi, a shit load of resistors, LEDs etc...
