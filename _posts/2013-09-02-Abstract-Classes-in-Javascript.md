What is Abstract?
-----------------

The idea of an abstract class is that it cannot be instantiated, that is you cannot create an Object
from it. An abstract class can have abstract methods and properties, as well as normal, inheritable 
methods. An abstract method means that a subclass must declare that method. An example of where
you might use one is as such.
