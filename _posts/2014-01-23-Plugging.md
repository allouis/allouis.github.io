When working with node applications I've often needed a plugin architecture, whether it be
with personal projects, the [Adapt framework](https://community.adaptlearning.org) or more recently
[jsbin](http://jsbin.com). Plugins can make an application much more flexible, especially if it's
distributable or a framework. They enable both you and other developers to add to and build 
upon your application in a non-intrusive way, with no modification to core code.

When integrating the [Stripe](http://stripe.com) payment service into jsbin, we had to ensure that
if it was running on a local machine or an environment that didn't support stripe, jsbin would 
continue to work. Our github auth module was built with the same idea. Here's a quick run through
how that was done.

First we require it and pass some options

{% highlight javascript %}
    
    var nodemailer = require('nodemailer'),
        express    = require('express'),
        //... more require statements
        url        = require('url'),
        github     = require('./github')(options), // if used, contains github.id
        flattened;

    //...
{% endhighlight %}

Then we initialize it

{% highlight javascript %}
    
    //...
    
    if (options.github && options.github.id) {
      github.initialize(app);
    }
    app.use(express.urlencoded());
    app.use(express.json());

    //...

{% endhighlight %}

After using the same technique with the stripe module, I realised that our app.js is going 
to become bloated if plugins keep getting added, so I set to work on a plugin architecture 
that is scalable and allows plugins to be added and removed with no application code change. 

This lead to Plugging, a small, easy to use module that will make all of the above easy
and painless.

To install to your project just run:
{% highlight bash %}
    npm install -S plugging
{% endhighlight %}

Plugins can take two forms, either as an object with a predefined 'init' method or as a function.
Here are two basic examples.

### As a function

{% highlight javascript %}
    /**
     *  /Users/allouis/dev/project/plugins/myPlugin/index.js
     */
    
    var APIRouteHandler = require('./lib/handlers/api'),
        APIAuth         = require('./lib/handlers/auth'),
        APIParamParser  = require('./lib/params/api');

    module.exports = function(options) {
        var app = options.app,
            APISecurityEnabled = options.API;

        if (APISecurityEnabled) {
            app.param('apiKey', APIParamParser);
            app.get(/api/:apiKey, APIRouteHandler); 
        }

    }

{% endhighlight %}

### As an object

{% highlight javascript %}
    /**
     *  /Users/allouis/dev/project/plugins/myPlugin.js
     *  You can define your plugins as both files and folder
     */

    var APIRouteHandler = require('./lib/handlers/api'),
        APIAuth         = require('./lib/handlers/auth'),
        APIParamParser  = require('./lib/params/api'),
        APISecurityEnabled;

    exports.init = function(options) {

        var app = options.app;
        APISecurityEnabled = options.API;

        if (APISecurityEnabled) {
            app.param('apiKey', APIParamParser);
            app.get(/api/:apiKey, APIRouteHandler); 
        }

    }

    exports.checkAPIKey = function(key) {
        if (!APISecurityEnabled) {
            return false;
        }
        return APIParamParser(key);
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}

Plugins as functions are my most common use case. Plugins that export an object for use as a public API
aren't plugins in the sense that they can be removed from a project and it'll continue to work. 
However, I've added support for them as I can see them being used in applications.

## Loading

Plugins are loaded via the initial call to the Plugging library, and can either be executed
immediately or later in the app. If your plugins need to be started at different times, you 
can have multiple calls to Plugging and store both references to start them up at seperate times.

### Deffered plugin loading

{% highlight javascript %}
    var http        = require('http'),
        express     = require('express'),
        options     = require('./config'),
        plugging    = require('plugging')(__dirname + '/plugins');
        // Pass in the path to your plugins directory
    
    var app = express();

    app.configure(function(){
        //...
    })

    var server = http.createServer(app);

    server.listen(app.get('port'));

    pluggings.start({
        app: app,
        API: options.API
    }) // this initializes the plugins passing all parameters to the plugin

{% endhighlight %}

### Immediate plugin loading

{% highlight javascript %}
    var http        = require('http'),
        express     = require('express'),
        options     = require('./config');
    
    var app = express();

    app.configure(function(){
        //...
    })

    var server = http.createServer(app);

    server.listen(app.get('port'));

    var pluginOptions = {
        app: app,
        API: app.get('port') === options.APIPort ? true : false
    }

    // If pluggings is passed more than one argument it initialises 
    // plugins immediately passing all extra parameters to plugins
    require('pluggings')(__dirname + '/plugins', pluginOptions);

{% endhighlight %}

## Configuration

You can configure how Plugging works on a basic level. At the moment there are two config options but 
I'm open to adding more as and when [requested](http://github.com/allouis/plugging/issues/new?title=Feature%20request).

{% highlight javascript %}
    {
        "node_modules": false,
        "init":"init"
    }

{% endhighlight %}

These are the default configs, setting `"node_modules": true` will tell Plugging to scan the top 
level of your node_modules, look for anything with a `"plugging: true"` in the package.json
and use that as a plugin. The `init` key is the name of the method that gets called on object 
style plugins when they're started.
