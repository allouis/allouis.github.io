Ahh, so it's finally here, my first post. And what should I talk about?
Well, it doesn;t matter eally as i'll probably delete this. 

I'm going to write an article on events in Javascript, not DOM events, that
would be too boring, but internal events, between objects. It helps decouple 
parts of your application and provides a neat way for people to plug in modules
to it.

Here's an example using my minivents.js library

Bad
===

{% highlight javascript %}
    var ModuleOne = {
        getNewData: function(){
            //gets data
            this.parse(data, {
                error: function(errorMsg){
                    ModuleTwo.openDialog(errorMsg);
                }
            });
        }
    }

    function ModuleTwo (){
        return {
            // public API stuff
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Good
====
    
{% highlight javascript %}
    var sandbox = new Events;

    var ModuleOne = {
        getNewData: function(){
            //gets data
            this.parse(data, {
                error: function(errorMsg){
                    sandbox.emit("data:error", errorMsg);
                }
            });
        }
    }

    function ModuleTwo (){
        sandbox.on("data:error", this.openDialog) 
        return {
            // public API stuff
        }
    }

{% endhighlight %}
Why?
====

The reason that the second version of that was better was because, what if 
ModuleTwo was never initialised for some reason? Or your boss decides he wants
to use ModuleThree instead of ModuleTwo and it has a different API, by using events
you remove the burden of calling methods from outside objects, and leave it up 
to the object that owns that method to do so.
